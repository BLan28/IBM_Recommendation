### Project Motivation
This is an project from Udacity - Data Scientist NanoDegree Course. The goal of this project is to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles that they will like.

Alongside meeting educational purposes, this project was designed solely for exploration hence no serious licensing process is required for this work. This work serves as an affirmation of the data science skills I've learned through various training programs, including the Udacity Data Science course. Feel free to use any part of the code if helpful to you or let us start a conversation over data analysis.
